# Style

ITowns can display vector data in two ways : the data can be displayed in a
[`View`][view] as 3D objects, or as entities that are projected on the ground.
You can see bellow pictures illustrating the two cases.

In both ways, the appearance and positioning of the vector data can be adjusted
by modifying the [`Style`][style] parameter of the [`Layer`][layer] the data is
displayed in. The [`Style`][style] in iTowns comes with several properties:

- `fill` allows defining style rules for polygons interior,
- `stroke` allows defining style rules for lines and polygons edges,
- `point` allows defining style rules for points.

Each of these three properties comes with a bunch of parameters to set vector
data appearance and positioning, such as `color`, `opacity`, `width`,
`base_altitude`... You can find a list of all the possible parameters in
[`Style` documentation][style].

These parameters can be set as static values or as functions of the vector data
properties. For example, let's suppose some vector data contains polygons.
Setting `fill.color` to `red` will color all the polygons in red. If on another
hand, all polygons come with a `color` property within the vector data, you can
access it within `Style` in two ways:

- either by using brackets, which in our example results in setting `fill.color`
  to `'{color}'` ;
- or by passing a method to the `fill.color` value. The first parameter of this
  method will automatically be an object containing all the properties of the
  vector data. In our example, the method could simply return the `color`
  property.

ITowns offers the possibility to display labels attached to points. The content
and appearance of the labels can be set the same way as for the polygons, lines
and points: using a [`Style`][style] property which is called `text`. For
instance, setting `text.field` to `'{name}'` will display a label on each point
that has a `name` property within the vector data. The content of the label will
be the content stored in the data under the `name` property.


## Vector data projected on the ground

When vector data are flattened on the ground, they are displayed in a
[`ColorLayer`][color]. In that case, the data basically consist in polygons,
lines or points. Their appearance can be adjusted by modifying the
[`Style`][style] of the [`ColorLayer`][color]. Yet, their positioning can't be
modified since it is computed so that tey appear projected on the ground.

## Vector data displayed as 3D objects

In the case of vector data represented as 3D objects, the data are displayed in
a [`GeometryLayer`][geom]. The appearance and positioning of the vector data
can be adjusted by modifying the [`Style`][style] of the
[`GeometryLayer`][geom]. Two parameters allow modifying the data position:

- `base_altitude` which defines the altitude at the base of the 3D objects ;
- `extrusion_height` which defines the height of the 3D objects, giving them
  volume.

For example, given a set of polygons, setting `fill.base_altitude` to `500` and
`fill.extrusion_height` to `20` will render extruded polygon expanding between
`500` and `520` meters of altitude.
