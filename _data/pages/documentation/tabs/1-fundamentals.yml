      description: "iTowns uses multiple bricks to display a wide range of data
                   such as  ortho-images, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) or 3D
                   models. Among those bricks, the preeminent ones are the
                   following:"
      dependencies:
        - title: ThreeJS
          text:
            - paragraph: JavaScript-based WebGL engine that can run GPU-powered
                         games and other graphics-powered apps straight from the
                         browser. The three.js library provides many features
                         and APIs for drawing 3D scenes in your browser.
        - title: WebGL
          text:
            - paragraph: WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for
                         rendering high-performance interactive 3D and 2D
                         graphics within any compatible web browser  without the
                         use of plug-ins. WebGL does so by introducing an API
                         that closely conforms to OpenGL ES 2.0 that can be used
                         in HTML canvas elements.
        - title: Proj4JS
          text:
            - paragraph: Proj4JS is a JavaScript library to transform
                         coordinates from one coordinate system to another,
                         including datum transformations. Originally a port of
                         PROJ (then known as PROJ.4) and GCTCP C (Archive) it is
                         a part of the MetaCRS group of projects.
